# DevOps-Projects   
A collection of hands-on projects that demonstrate my work with Docker, Kubernetes and general DevOps practices.

## About  
This repository showcases practical DevOps, automation and infrastructure-as-code examples I’ve built as part of my learning journey. It includes Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, YAML configurations, Linux workflows and automation scripts that reflect real-world scenarios and best practices.

The goal is to document my progression while creating a portfolio of repeatable, reusable and demonstrable projects that support my long-term development in DevOps, platform engineering and cloud automation.

## Repository Structure  
- `Working with Linux/` — Linux-focused examples, scripts and workflows  
- `Working with Yaml/` — YAML files for Kubernetes manifests, GitHub Actions workflows and configuration templates  
- Additional folders will be added as more projects are developed  

## Upcoming Additions  
I will be creating a separate repository dedicated entirely to **learning common DevOps tools from scratch**. This new repo will follow a structured approach covering topics such as:  
- Core Linux fundamentals (my starting point)  
- Git & version control  
- Docker and container fundamentals  
- Kubernetes  
- Terraform  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Monitoring and logging tools  
- Cloud fundamentals (Azure, AWS, GCP)  

The first section of that learning repository will focus on **Linux**, covering essential topics every Linux engineer should know, including:  
- SSH and server access  
- journalctl and log analysis  
- The Linux boot process  
- systemd and service management
- Permissions, users and groups  
- Diagnosing crashes, performance issues and service failures    
- Filesystems and storage  
- Package management  
- Networking tools and troubleshooting  


This will help build a strong technical foundation before progressing into more advanced DevOps tools.
