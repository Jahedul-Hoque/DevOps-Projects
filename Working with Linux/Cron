Cron is the tool that allows scheduling within Linux.

It's a traditional tool thats not used much as its very simple and is replaced by the modern systemd timer.

Cron lives in etc/crontab

Weaknesses:

    - No dependancy handling
    - No logging by default or service supervision
    - Simple but can be unreliable for complex tasks

Example of cron syntax:

0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh


^

Run backup.sh at 02:00 every day
