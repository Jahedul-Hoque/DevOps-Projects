Stage 1: BIOS/UEFI
Power-On: The process begins when the computer is powered on.

BIOS/UEFI Initialization: The system's firmware (BIOS or UEFI) starts and performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST) to verify that the hardware components are working correctly.

Bootloader Search: It then looks for a bootable device to find the bootloader. 



Stage 2: Bootloader (e.g., GRUB)

Bootloader Loading: The BIOS/UEFI loads the bootloader, such as the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB), from the Master Boot Record (MBR) or EFI System Partition.

Kernel Loading: GRUB presents a menu for the user to choose an operating system or kernel version (if available) and then loads the selected kernel into memory. 



Stage 3: Kernel
Kernel Initialization: The kernel begins to initialize itself and its devices. It decompresses in memory, sets up memory management, and detects hardware.

Root Filesystem Mount: The kernel mounts the root filesystem to access necessary files and drivers. 



Stage 4: Init process

Init Program Execution: The kernel starts the init program, which is the first process (with Process ID 1).

System Initialization: The init process (like systemd in modern systems) takes over and begins to bring up the rest of the system by mounting other filesystems and starting all the necessary services and daemons (like networking and logging).

Login Prompt: The system is now ready to provide a login prompt, either in a text-based console or a graphical desktop environment.
