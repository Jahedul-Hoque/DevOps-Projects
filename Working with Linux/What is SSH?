OpenSSH is a secure way of remoting onto a linux endpoint.

It's done with private and public keys.

Private Key: Sits on the .ssh folder of the machine you're connecting from
Public Key: Sits on the authorised_key directory of a linux end point
Authentication is only successful with SSH when both keys match.

Public keys usually start with: "ssh-rsa ABCDEFKJASHDKJ..." or "ssh-ed25519 ASDNBJCBJSHSADAS"
You can typically find them on the .shh directory of the SSH Client you're remoting on from or from your ..ssh folder on your linux machine.

SSH have encrypted tunnels that allow for a secure connection between 2 endpoints.
SSH Connection is typically sat on port 22
