OpenSSH is a secure way of remoting onto a linux endpoint.

It's done with private and public keys.

Private Key: Sits on the .ssh folder of the machine you're connecting from
Public Key: Sits on the authorised_key directory of a linux end point
Authentication is only successful with SSH when both keys match.

Public keys usually start with: "ssh-rsa ABCDEFKJASHDKJ..." or "ssh-ed25519 ASDNBJCBJSHSADAS"
You can typically find them on the .shh directory of the SSH Client you're remoting on from or from your ..ssh folder on your linux machine.

SSH have encrypted tunnels that allow for a secure connection between 2 endpoints.
SSH Connection is typically sat on port 22

Known host files are also stored on the .ssh folder for an extra layer of security.
Known host files contain 3 values per entry.
Hostname/IP Address, KeyType, Host Key

Before remoting onto a machime, the SSH service looks into the known hostfile to verify if the signature of the machine is currently on there. If it isnt, then it outputs that the signature is unknown and confirms with the user if they want to remote in.
After remoting in, it adds the new signature onto the known host file.
This can add an extra layer of security incase there's an interception between 2 endpoints or a "middle man".
